	<h2>What is CSS?</h2>
	<p>For those who don't know, CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which sounds scary
		and difficult but couldn't be simpler. Along with <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
		CSS makes up the core display of a website. Basically, HTML structures the website and CSS makes everything look gorgeous through positioning, color schemes, borders and much more!</p>
	<h2>Starting with CSS</h2>
	<p>If you come from HTML, you know that you need a text editor to edit webpages. For newcomers, a text editor is just what it 
	sounds like: it's used to edit plain text. There is usually a default text editor on Windows computers (Notepad), but I would 
	recommend Notepad++. It hightlights different parts of your code so that you can distinguish it and easily locate what you need.</p>
	<h2>Ways to Implement CSS</h2>
	<pre>There are 3 different ways to implement CSS in a webpage.
	
1. In-line: the CSS is written on the same line as the HTML it modifies, highly discouraged
2. Internal: the CSS is written in the head tags at the top of the HTML document, not the best way to style a site with many pages
3. In a stylesheet: the CSS is written in an entirely different file, the best way to style an entire website with one file, must be linked 
via a link tag in the head tag
	
This site will focus on the third manner of implementing CSS. In an effort to reduce clutter on this page, all examples will be displayed 
in the gallery page. Head on over there to see examples of all three ways to add CSS to a website.
	</pre>
	<h2>Syntax Rules</h2>
	<p>Syntax rules for CSS are simple: a tag name is followed by a pair of curly braces and all CSS code inside of the braces. To apply a style, 
	a property such as width is followed by a colon, a value such as 100px, and finally a semi-colon.</p>
	<h2>ID please! Class is in session</h2>
	<p>Two important aspects of CSS are the ID and class. An ID is given to an HTML element to single out that element and apply a style to it. A 
	class is basically the same thing except you apply it to multiple elements that you want to style the same way.</p>
	<h2>A Select(or) Few</h2>
	<pre>Just about any HTML property can be changed. Some common ones are width, height, text-align, and margin, which are all self-explanatory. 
	
You can change the background color with the background property, set a border with the border property, or change text color with 
guess which property? The text property, of course! Some properties have different units for their values. Colors can be set with hexadecimal 
values, color names or RGB values. Sizes can be set with pixels or percentages. As long as you know HTML tags, you know the basics of CSS.
	
Various text selectors include font-family, font-size, font-weight (bold or normal text), font-style (italic or normal), and text-decoration 
(underline, overline, or line-through).
	
A border obviously borders an element on the page. It can be different sizes, dashed or dotted, and different colors.
	
Padding gives space between an element's border and the actual content.
	
Click the buttons at the bottom of the page to see how CSS can completely and easily change the style of a site. Background colors, colors, and background images are 
changed for each different button. Refreshing the page or going to another page will revert back to the default style.</pre>
	
	<h2>Your turn</h2>
	<p>If you don't want to write CSS with your own text editor, you can head over to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default">W3 Schools</a> 
	to test out some CSS in an online editor.</p>
	
	<h2>That's all folks!</h2>
	<p>Believe it or not, you know the basics of CSS. There are plenty of tutorials on the web with actual code samples, but I just wanted to 
	introduce you to the idea of CSS and what it can do. Your only limit is your imagination.</p>
